# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based system developed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on a variety of clinical parameters. It is designed to support healthcare professionals in making faster, more accurate risk assessments and contribute to preventative healthcare practices.

The work presented here is based on a team project developed for CE101 at the University of Essex. The code was adapted from the open-source repository by Melanie Walsh ([original repo here](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/heart-disease-prediction)) and expanded upon for educational and practical implementation purposes.

## Features

- Predictive analysis using multiple ML algorithms:  
  - Random Forest  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Naive Bayes  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Visual performance evaluation using confusion matrices and accuracy charts  
- Permutation importance analysis for feature evaluation  

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), which includes clinical features such as:

- Age, cholesterol, blood pressure  
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)  
- Presence of chest pain, diabetes, and more
